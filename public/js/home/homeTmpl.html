        Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Richard Reynolds.  I'm a web developer because somewhere along the line I fell in love with the idea of being able to build something of real value with nothing more than a computer and thoughtful ingenuity.  I am currently focused and developing MEAN stack web applications.  Please feel free to click around the site to get to know me and my work better.
