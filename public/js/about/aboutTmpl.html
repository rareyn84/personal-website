      I'm awesome.  When I was five I could solve a rubix cube in 5 seconds.  I first reached the peak Mt. Everest when I was twelve and have reached it every three years since.  Why three?  Because it's awesome.  I was a millionaire at age 15 and a billionaire by yesterday.  So yeah, making it rain is a hobby of mine.  I'm also a web-developer when I feel like it.
